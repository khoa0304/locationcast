Welcome to Elasticsearch Server Second Edition. In the second edition of the book,
we decided not only to do the update to match the latest version of Elasticsearch but
also to add some additional important sections that we didn't think of while writing
the first book. While reading this book, you will be taken on a journey through
a wonderful world of full-text search provided by the Elasticsearch server. We will
start with a general introduction to Elasticsearch, which covers how to start and run
Elasticsearch, what are the basic concepts of Elasticsearch, and how to index and
search your data in the most basic way.
This book will also discuss the query language, so-called Querydsl, that allows
you to create complicated queries and filter the returned results. In addition to all
this, you'll see how you can use faceting to calculate aggregated data based on the
results returned by your queries, and how to use the newly introduced aggregation
framework (the analytics engine allows you to give meaning to your data). We will
implement autocomplete functionality together and learn how to use Elasticsearch
spatial capabilities and prospective search.
Finally, this book will show you Elasticsearch administration API capabilities
with features such as shard placement control and cluster handling.
